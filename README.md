## üîê IMPORTANT: API Key Security Warning

**Warning:** As of this commit, all API keys (for MapTiler, OpenWeather, YouTube) and the SheetDB URL are **hard-coded** directly into the `.jsx` components.

This is a major security risk. Anyone with access to this code can steal and misuse your keys.

You **MUST** secure them using environment variables before deploying this project or making the repository public.
